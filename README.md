# How It's Made Section
 - In the NAV BAR on the top left of the screen, please click "How It's Made" to learn about the details behind our project
 - Here is what you will find embedded in the website: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DBjzyTaGJhTi7YqW3e9asLseoErg5awi92WLcfcfcIk/edit?usp=sharing

# About The Project
 -  A movie website that utilizes a web API and effective algorithims to suggest movies and streamers; based upon your previous choices in the quiz we will form 

# Tactics & Approaches 
 - We will create a question set that repopulates itself, instead of having to make a new page for each question on the quiz
 - We will create a login/signup page to create a more personalized experience for the user
 - We will assign roles that highlight each of our team-members strengths (see project plan for more details on our roles)

# Crossover info
 - We communicated with the Pladypodes to create a matching algorithm idea, both repolutating a question set for each question.
 - Our tactic is to use a quiz, and then recieve a result for "Which movie" after querying the database 
 - In order to give results, our teams both used tables to display the final data
