# Project Overview:
This project is meant to give the user a series of questions that will then reveal the best college for the user. Our database will include thousands of possible options for colleges for the user and the information will be obtained by a python web scraper.

# Project Scrum Board Link:
This Project Board contains the progress made by the scrum members to complete the big ticket item/idea and the assignments the srum master assigns his scrum members.

# Project Details
- Questions asked: User will be asked questions that help us gear them towards which college they would prefer.
- Ex. What is your ideal major?
    What kind of careers most interest you?
    Where is your ideal location for college?
    Are you more inclined towards academics or sports?
    Do you have an interest in Greek Life?
    What is your weighted GPA?
    What campus lifestyle do you prefer?
    Do you have a budget? If so, what is your prefered range per year?
    Are you interested in going to graduate school? If so, which one?
- Based off of information collected from user input, our database would perform a query and select the colleges that make the most sense for the user. These would   then be displayed on the page and the user would have the option to explore the college link and read more about each feature.
- Our database would be a local created from SQLAlchemy and data would be entered from a scraping program we are hoping to write

## Backup Project
If this project presents to be too difficult within the first couple of weeks and the team cannot figure out how to work the scraping together with the databas, we have approval from Mr. John to switch our project. Our second idea is to have a movie database with a Netflix inspired query. Users would be able to search movies by genre, year, actors, producers, names, etc. There would also be an option to add movies to the database, provided all the information is present in the Create feature. If we do end up doing this project, we will create a more elaborate project plan

# Fridays
Every Friday the scrum group will meet up for atleast 5 minutes to discuss plans for the future and any possible assignments assigned to each scrum member over the weekend.
# Midterm
By the Midterm, what should be finished is the "scraping data" part of our project and the base of our flask website which has the use of SQLAlchemy in it.
# Night at the Museum
By the time Night at the Museum comes around, The project should be nearly finished and ready to run off the rasberry pi.
# College Board
To meet and exceed College Board requirements, this project will include a SQLAlchemy Database,Web scraper, will be a deployed Web Site on Raspberry Pi server, and will be way more advanced than the websites created from trimester 1.
