<h2> Criteria Met </h2>

<p> 1. I added a blueprint in the python file that says "nick.py found in minilabs/nick
    and cataloged the project to the main.py. I then made a route that referred the blueprint to the html template and
    showed the final results on the mini lab </p>

<p> 2. I developed a class in the python file "nickminilab1.py which is located in the github minilab directory.  </p>

<p>3. In the nick.py file I was able to create an object  </p>

<p>4. To print and view properly, I use a python file for a loop in the html file "nickminilab1" to access the data
    processed in the python scripts.</p>

<p>5. Reflection/Wow: the main structure of the minilab was the wow aspect towards my project. The concept of the startup
    design were to influence motivated speculators the desire to add beneficial ideas toward their secular interest. </p>
